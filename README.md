# GPT-3.5-turbo Transcript Summarizer

This script uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI to summarize a transcript into bullet points. The generated bullet points will include relevant details such as numbers, people, or company names, while ignoring timestamps. The input transcript is read from a text file and the summarized bullet points are written to another text file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- An OpenAI API key
- The `openai` library installed in your Python environment

## Usage

1. Save the input transcript in a text file named 'Ed-and-AppWorks.txt', where each item is separated by commas.

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable or replace the placeholder value in the script:

```python
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name you saved the script as.

4. The script will create an output file named 'output.txt', containing the summarized bullet points generated by the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

## How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. Reads the content of the input file 'Ed-and-AppWorks.txt'.
2. Splits the content into items based on commas.
3. Converts the item list to a string.
4. Sets the OpenAI API key.
5. Initializes a loop that processes the input text in chunks of 4000 characters or less.
6. Makes a request to the GPT-3.5-turbo model with the current chunk, asking the model to rewrite the transcript into bullet points, including relevant details and ignoring timestamps.
7. Appends the generated bullet points to an output string.
8. Writes the output string to the output file 'output.txt'.
9. Prints "Done" when the process is complete.
